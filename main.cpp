Project 3 - Part 1e / 5
Video:  Chapter 2 Part 5
User-Defined Types

Continue your work on branch Part1

Purpose: The entire purpose of this 5-part project is to get you writing C++ code that compiles and to 
reinforce the syntax habits that C++ requires.  
What you create in this project will be used as the basis of Project 5 in the course.   

************************
Part1 purpose:  Learn to write UDTs

You are going to write 10 UDTs in project3.  
    Part 1a: you will learn to think about an object in terms of its sub-objects.
    Part 1b: you will write 4 un-related UDTs in plain english
    Part 1c: you will write 1 UDT in plain english that will be made of 5 related sub-objects
    Part 1d: you will write plain-english UDTs for the 5 sub-objects that form the UDT defined in Part 1c
    Part 1e: you will convert those 10 plain-english UDTs into code that runs.
************************

Convert your 10 Plain-english UDTs into code.

I recommend compiling after finishing each one and making sure it compiles 
without errors or warnings before moving on to writing the next UDT. 

1) define an empty struct for each of your 10 types. i.e.:
*/
struct CellPhone
{

};
/*
2) Copy your 5 properties & 3 actions into the empty struct body.
    - comment them out.
    
3) declare your member variables and member functions underneath each plain-english comment in your struct's body.
    - give the member variables relevant data types
 
4) make the function parameter list for those member functions use some of your User-Defined Types
    - You'll write definitions/implementations for these functions in Project3 Part2
    - you'll call each of these functions in Project3 part3
 
5) make 2 of the 10 user-defined types have a nested class.  
    - this nested class also needs 5 properties and 3 actions.
    - these nested classes are not considered one of your 10 UDTs.
    - this nested class must be related to the class it is nested inside
 
6) your 10th UDT's properties should be instances of your #5-#9 UDTs.   
    - No primitives allowed!
 
7) After you finish defining each type, click the [run] button.  
    Clear up any errors or warnings as best you can.
